Developed a lost and found website using Python to create a platform for students and staff to report lost or found items on campus. The web application features a database to log item details including photos, descriptions, and contact info. Users can browse listings, mark items as claimed and submit forms to add new lost or found reports. This application provides a useful service for the campus community to reunite lost items with their owners.
